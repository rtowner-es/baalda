# Relaunch Skill Guide

Kills the current desktop (Tauri) dev process tree **and** the backend server, then
starts fresh instances of both. Postgres (Docker) is **left running** — restarting
the server process does not touch the DB, so no re-seed is needed.

Project: `/Users/macbook/Documents/Baalda/app`
- Desktop launch: `npm run dev:desktop` (= `npm run tauri dev -w desktop`; Vite on :1420) from the app root.
- Server launch: `npm run dev` from `app/apps/server/` (tsx watch; HTTP :3010, Hocuspocus WS :3011, GET /health).

## Steps

### 1. Kill the running instances
Kill both the desktop dev chain (`dev:desktop` → `tauri dev` → `vite` →
`target/debug/desktop`) and the backend server (`tsx src/index.ts`).

```bash
# Desktop
pkill -f "target/debug/desktop"        # the Tauri app binary
pkill -f "node_modules/.bin/tauri"     # tauri dev
pkill -f "node_modules/.bin/vite"      # desktop's Vite dev server
pkill -f "dev:desktop"                 # the npm wrapper(s)
pkill -f "tauri dev"                   # npm run tauri dev
# Backend server
pkill -f "tsx.*src/index.ts"           # the Node/tsx server
pkill -f "apps/server"                 # server npm wrapper
sleep 1
# Confirm nothing survived:
pgrep -fl "tauri dev|node_modules/.bin/vite|target/debug/desktop|tsx.*src/index.ts" || echo "all stopped"
```

If `pgrep` still lists survivors, `kill -9` them by PID.

### 2. Make sure Postgres is up
The server needs Postgres (Docker, host port 5439). It usually stays up across
restarts — only start it if it's missing.

```bash
docker ps --filter "publish=5439" --format "{{.Names}} {{.Status}}" || true
# If nothing is listed, from app/apps/server/ run: npm run db:up
```

Do **not** run `npm run migrate` unless migrations changed, and never run
`npm test` in `apps/server` (it wipes the dev DB / users/orgs/vaults).

### 3. Launch the backend server
Run in the **background** from the server dir. Use the Bash tool with
`run_in_background: true`.

```bash
cd /Users/macbook/Documents/Baalda/app/apps/server && npm run dev
```

### 4. Launch the desktop
Run in the **background** from the app root. Use the Bash tool with
`run_in_background: true`.

```bash
cd /Users/macbook/Documents/Baalda/app && npm run dev:desktop
```

### 5. Confirm both came up
- **Server** (wait ~3–5s): `curl -s http://localhost:3010/health` returns OK, and
  the task output shows the HTTP :3010 / Hocuspocus WS listeners started.
- **Desktop** (wait ~15–20s; cargo may recompile): tail the background task output.
  Success looks like:

```
VITE v7.x ready ...
Running `target/debug/desktop`
```

If `tauri.conf.json` or Rust changed, expect a `Compiling desktop` / `Rebuilding
application...` step before `Running target/debug/desktop`.

## Notes
- If a process was launched from a Claude background shell in this session, kill that
  background task too (via its task id) so its output stream closes cleanly.
- Restarting the **server process** is safe — it does not re-seed or wipe anything.
  Only `npm test` in `apps/server` wipes the DB.
- A `tauri.conf.json` edit auto-triggers a rebuild in a *running* `tauri dev`, so a
  full relaunch is only needed when the watcher isn't running or you want a clean slate.
