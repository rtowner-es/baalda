 * Effective-permission resolver (spec 04 §3, plus locks).
 *
 *   1. Workspace owner/admin  -> `edit` on everything in the workspace.
 *   2. Else take the MAX of: a share on the file itself, a share on a
 *      containing folder (walking parent_id up to the root), and a
 *      workspace-scoped grant (org-wide "Open"/"Read-only", or per-user).
 *   3. `edit > view > none`. Folder grants inherit to descendants; a file
 *      share can only RAISE permission. No matching grant -> `none`.
 *
 * A plain `member` inherits the workspace grant (Open by default) and so gets
 * `edit`; with no grant at all it has no content access (`none`).
 *
 * Locks (permission = 'locked') are a DENY overlay resolved AFTER the rules
 * above: when a lock matches the doc or any ancestor folder — for this user
 * (principal_type 'user') or the whole workspace (principal_type 'org') — the
 * result is capped at `view`. Owners/admins are capped too (the point of a
 * lock is protecting content from accidental edits); they can still unlock
 * via the shares API. A lock never GRANTS access: `none` stays `none`.
