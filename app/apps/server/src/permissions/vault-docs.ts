/**
 * The set of doc_ids in a vault a user may **read** (spec 05 §3.1). This is the
 * set-based dual of `effectivePermission` ([[resolver]]) for one whole vault, so
 * the vault channel can compute a subscriber's readable set in a couple of
 * queries instead of one resolve per doc.
 *
 * Mirrors the resolver exactly:
 *   - workspace owner/admin  -> every (non-deleted) note + file in the vault;
 *   - a workspace-scoped view/edit grant (org-wide "Open"/"Read-only" for
 *     members, or per-user) -> likewise every doc in the vault;
 *   - otherwise             -> docs reachable via a **user** share (view/edit)
 *     on the doc itself or any ancestor folder (folder grants inherit down).
 *
 * `locked` is a deny-overlay that only caps edit->view; it never grants read, so
 * it's absent here.
 *
 * Read = view OR edit, so the channel streams content to view-only grantees too.
