// First-run vault seeding. A brand-new, empty vault gets a starter set of
// interlinked notes so it isn't an empty void — and so the graph view has
// something to show from day one. The set is a small, self-explanatory second
// brain: a root `Welcome`, a `Map of Content` hub, and three folders
// (`Getting Started`, `Concepts`, `Examples`) whose notes link to one another
// with `[[wikilinks]]`. Those links become graph edges (they resolve by
// basename), so a fresh workspace opens onto a populated constellation.
//
// This runs once, only when the vault has no notes and no folders — see
// `vaultIsEmpty`. Content is written with `write_note` (full-file, atomic)
// rather than `create_note` (which would prepend its own H1), so we control the
// exact Markdown. `write_note` creates any missing parent folder, so each note
// materializes its folder on its own.

Baalda is your **local-first second brain** — notes that live as plain Markdown
files on your own computer.

What makes it different:

- **Your files, your disk.** Every note is a real \`.md\` file in this folder. No
  lock-in — open them in any editor, back them up, sync them however you like.
- **Write together, live.** Invite teammates and edit the same note at the same
  time, with cursors and presence — like a shared doc, but still just files.
- **Your AI can edit too.** Connect an assistant like Claude and let it read and
  write these notes directly, right alongside you.

Most tools give you one of these. Baalda is the bridge between all three.

## Start here

- 🧭 [[Map of Content]] — a hand-made index of everything in this vault.
- 🚀 [[How Baalda works]] — a two-minute tour of the essentials.
- 🕸️ [[The graph view]] — see how these notes connect.

> These starter notes are already linked together, which is why your graph
> isn't empty. Delete them whenever you like — this is your space.

Happy writing. ✍️

    body: `# Map of Content

A **Map of Content** (MOC) is a note whose only job is to link to other notes.
It's how you navigate a vault by hand instead of by folders. This one indexes
your starter set — see [[Maps of Content]] for the idea behind it.

    body: `# How Baalda works

A quick tour of the essentials. This whole note is just a Markdown file — try
editing it as you read.

## 1. Everything is a file

Notes are plain \`.md\` files in this folder. Create one with **⌘N**, organise
them in the sidebar, and connect them with [[Wikilinks and backlinks]]. See
[[Local-first notes]] for why that matters, and [[Keyboard shortcuts]] to move
faster.

## 2. Work together in real time

Sign in and create (or join) a **workspace** to sync this vault across your
devices and with your team — more in [[Collaborating with your team]].

## 3. Bring in your AI

Baalda speaks **MCP**, so an assistant like Claude can work in your vault
directly — see [[Working with your AI]].

When you're ready, the [[Map of Content]] links to everything else.
`,
  },
  {
    path: "Getting Started/Keyboard shortcuts.md",
    body: `# Keyboard shortcuts

The handful worth memorising first:

| Action | Shortcut |
| --- | --- |
| New note | **⌘N** |
| Quick open / search | **⌘P** |
| Toggle the [[The graph view]] | **⌘G** |
| Bold / italic | **⌘B** / **⌘I** |
| Insert a \`[[wikilink]]\` | type \`[[\` |

Typing \`[[\` starts a link — that's the core move behind
[[Wikilinks and backlinks]]. Back to [[How Baalda works]].
`,
  },
  {
    path: "Getting Started/Working with your AI.md",
    body: `# Working with your AI

Baalda exposes your vault over **MCP**, so an assistant like **Claude** (in
Claude Desktop or Cowork) can read and write these notes directly.

1. Open **Workspace Settings → MCP** and create a connection token.
2. Add it to Claude as an MCP server.
3. Ask Claude to search, summarise, and write notes — its edits appear here
   live, exactly the way a teammate's would (see [[Collaborating with your team]]).

Good first tasks: turn your [[Ideas inbox]] into [[Atomic notes]], or draft a
[[Weekly review]]. Back to [[How Baalda works]].
`,
  },
  {
    path: "Getting Started/Collaborating with your team.md",
    body: `# Collaborating with your team

A **workspace** syncs this vault across your devices and with people you invite.

- Open the same note as a teammate and you'll see each other's cursors.
- Edits **merge** in real time — nothing gets overwritten.
- Share a single folder or the whole vault; permissions are per-folder.

Try it on [[Meeting notes]] or a [[Website launch]] plan. Your AI joins the same
way — see [[Working with your AI]]. Back to [[How Baalda works]].

  // ── Concepts ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  {
    path: "Concepts/Local-first notes.md",
    body: `# Local-first notes

**Local-first** means the source of truth lives on *your* device, not a server.
Your notes are plain \`.md\` files you fully own — they work offline, open in any
editor, and sync only when you choose.

Syncing is additive, not a dependency: turn it on for
[[Collaborating with your team]], turn it off and everything still works. This is
the foundation the rest of [[How Baalda works]] builds on.
`,
  },
  {
    path: "Concepts/Wikilinks and backlinks.md",
    body: `# Wikilinks and backlinks

A **wikilink** connects one note to another: write \`[[Atomic notes]]\` and it
becomes a link. The note you link *to* automatically gains a **backlink** —
a list of everything pointing at it.

Links are the real structure of a vault (folders are secondary). Enough of them
and you get [[The graph view]], and you can curate them by hand with
[[Maps of Content]]. This idea powers [[Atomic notes]] and [[Daily notes]].
`,
  },
  {
    path: "Concepts/Maps of Content.md",
    body: `# Maps of Content

A **Map of Content** (MOC) is a note that links to a cluster of related notes —
a table of contents you write by hand. Use one whenever a topic grows past a few
notes.

They pair naturally with [[Wikilinks and backlinks]]: the MOC links out, the
backlinks point home. Your vault's top-level MOC is the [[Map of Content]]. See
also [[Atomic notes]].
`,
  },
  {
    path: "Concepts/Atomic notes.md",
    body: `# Atomic notes

An **atomic note** holds *one* idea, titled so you can link to it later. Small
notes recombine — one idea can support many others through
[[Wikilinks and backlinks]].

It's the core habit from [[How to Take Smart Notes]]. Capture rough thoughts in
your [[Ideas inbox]] first, then split them into atomic notes. Gather related
ones under [[Maps of Content]].
`,
  },
  {
    path: "Concepts/Daily notes.md",
    body: `# Daily notes

A **daily note** is one page per day — a log, a scratchpad, a landing spot for
whatever comes up. Link out from it liberally with [[Wikilinks and backlinks]].

Daily notes feed two rhythms: drop half-formed thoughts into your
[[Ideas inbox]], and roll the week up in your [[Weekly review]].
`,
  },
  {
    path: "Concepts/The graph view.md",
    body: `# The graph view

The **graph** draws every note as a node and every [[Wikilinks and backlinks]]
connection as an edge. Press **⌘G** (see [[Keyboard shortcuts]]) to open it.

It's a fast way to *see* your thinking: clusters are topics, hubs are your
[[Maps of Content]], and lonely nodes are notes worth linking. The vault you're
reading now is why your graph isn't empty. Back to the [[Map of Content]].

Notes on Sönke Ahrens' book — the case for the *Zettelkasten* method.

## Key ideas

- Write **[[Atomic notes]]** in your own words — one idea each.
- Link every note to others so ideas find each other later
  ([[Wikilinks and backlinks]]).
- Don't file by folder; let structure emerge, then curate with
  [[Maps of Content]].

A single place to dump raw thoughts fast, so nothing gets lost. Process it later

- [ ] Empty the [[Ideas inbox]] into [[Atomic notes]]
- [ ] Skim this week's [[Daily notes]]
- [ ] Update project notes like [[Website launch]]
